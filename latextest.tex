Hello! This is a test to check if Latex is working properly. The following is
an example of Maxwell's equations to check that everything is working properly:
\begin{align}
    \oint_{\partial \mathcal{U}} \mathbb{E} \cdot \mathrm{d} \mathbb{S} &= \frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0}
    \int_{\mathcal{U}} \rho \, \mathrm{d} V \\
    \oint_{\partial \mathcal{U}} \mathbb{B} \cdot \mathrm{d} \mathbb{S} &= 0.
\end{align}

This is a new paragraph. The following is the well-known Euler identity, which
involves the most elementary constants in mathematics:
\begin{equation}
    \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} \pi} + 1 = 0.
\end{equation}

Yet again, this paragraph is set to test the continous integration of the
zathura pdf viewer regarding autocompilation. In this case the chosen equation 
for testing is the normal density function,
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{N}_{\mu, \sigma}(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} \, \mathrm{e}^{\frac{1}{2} \big( \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} \big)^2}.
\end{equation}

I'm getting the hang of this. Let's try now with an algebraic equation. The
following equation is the main conclusion of the \emph{first decomposition
theorem}, which is used to provide a decomposition of a vector space with the
Cayley-Hamilton theorem:
\begin{equation}
    \ker\big( P(D) \big) = \bigoplus_{i = 1}^{m} \ker \big( (D - \lambda_{i} I)^{m_i} \big).
\end{equation}
